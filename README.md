<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

Downloads and installs guardsquare and ixguard in order to process and protect an archive. If the correct version of iXGuard is already detected, the download will be skipped.

### Configuring the Step

To be able to use the Step, you need to create and register an ssh key to grant permission to Guardsquare.

1. Create key pair using `ssh-keygen`.
2. Create a secure passphrase for your private key.
3. Upload the public key `.pub` to your Guardsquare account.
4. Upload the private key file to the **Files** secion of your Bitrise project.
5. Create a **Secret Env Variable** for the private key passphrase (make sure to escape any special characters with a `\` before saving).
6. If your file download URL or Secret Env Variable does not correspond with the defaults, make sure you list them as inputs to the Step.
