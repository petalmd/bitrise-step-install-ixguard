  Downloads and installs guardsquare and ixguard in order to process and protect an archive. If the correct version of iXGuard is already detected, the download will be skipped.

  ### Configuring the Step

  To be able to use the Step, you need to create and register an ssh key to grant permission to Guardsquare.

  1. Create key pair using `ssh-keygen`.
  2. Create a secure passphrase for your private key.
  3. Upload the public key `.pub` to your Guardsquare account.
  4. Upload the private key file to the **Files** secion of your Bitrise project.
  5. Create a **Secret Env Variable** for the private key passphrase (make sure to escape any special characters with a `\` before saving).
  6. If your file download URL or Secret Env Variable does not correspond with the defaults, make sure you list them as inputs to the Step.
